# Intro

ParaParaVR

# Mechanics

Players of the game will have to move their arms in time to music while also moving their arms through or hitting markers.

Additionally, the game will have a built in editor that will allow any user to create their own charts to music of their choosing.

# Dynamics

The goal of the game is to be as accurate as possible when hitting any markers. Depending on how close the timing is or how close the player is, the more points they will earn.

# Aesthetics

The look will be somewhat futuristic.
